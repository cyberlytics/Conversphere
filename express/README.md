This is a simple Express App with TypeScript. 
The app is built with TypeScript and then run with Node.js. 
It uses Nodemon to run the app as a dev server.

It is a great starting point for building Express Apps with TypeScript!
Have Fun!

# Start with installing dependencies:
npm install

## Build Express App with TypeScript to dist folder as JavaScript:
npm run build

## Start Express App with JavaScript from dist folder:
npm run start-build

## Run Express App with TypeScript as Dev Server with Nodemon:
npm run dev
# This will create the dist folder to see the compiled JavaScript

## Run Express App only with Nodemon (without JavaScript):
npm start
# Attention: This will not create the dist folder and if there is an old dist folder, it won`t be changed!
